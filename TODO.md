# TODOs

- Make this run in a VM
- Make action.py automatically save SampleStates into its directory (A cli flag)
- Make main script listen on keyboards to be activated on demand
    - Also a keyboard option to not go into events and just be a helper that skips popups
- Auto-Duel Vagabonds with OpenCV states
